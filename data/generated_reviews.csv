I went on to get my Rescue, divemaster and eventually became an Instructor... all because of the great service, fantastic instructors, and the warm and fuzzy feeling I got from everyone.

220,olivia.davis24@yahoo.com,"Been a while since we posted. Haven't been too many places recently.I was headed to a local lunch spot downtown earlier than usual due to a 12:30 meeting (12:30 seriously) and this was the first place we found that was serving lunch to the 1st lunch period crowd (remember those poor kids in elementary school that pulled the short straw and ate lunch at 11 AM - that was us that day).Now I am not a drinker.  My dog imbibes more than I do, so the beer list was kind of lost on me (besides, I always think it is bad mojo to go into a meeting after lunch and wreak of anything, especially alcohol).My CW and I were the first to be seated - maybe that was our mistake.  She ordered the quiche of the day and I ordered a sirloin burger w sweet potato fries.Her salad was okay.  Nice greens although not much else going on in it.From there, it went straight downhill.  When CW's quiche arrived, it was lovely to look at - leeks and andouille sausage - and cold.  Not warm, not cooler than you would prefer. It was flipping cold.  So she explained that to the waiter who took it back.  Then she waited and waited and waited.  Expecting it to be nuked, this was taking quite a while.When he brought the plate out, it was a new piece of quiche - he explained that when they tried to heat up the original piece, it crumbled so they made a new quiche.  As a former waitstaff (waitress but trying to be PC here), I would have stayed around and made sure that this piece was more to her liking. But he bolted. And - you guessed - this piece was equally as bad.Now I know - you are going to say she was picky.  But I actually touched the quiche to allay my fears and it was flipping cold.  My guess The quiches were either chilled or frozen and they didn't know how to reheat them.  She ended up with a 12 of a chicken salad panini with dried cherries although I will be darned if there were any dried cherries in it.  So CW is going vote this bistro off the island.My lunch  I ordered the Brew-a-Burger Sirloin rare.  When it came, I don't think it was much warmer than CW's quiche - yes, I order it rare and expect the inside to be warm but I also expect the outside to be hot which it wasn't.  The cheese sat on the top and never softened, let alone melted.  I also expect a rare burger to be flavorful without the addition of much else - and it wasn't.  About 12 way through, I almost wondered if they had given me a ground chicken burger in error.  At that point, I figured it was not worth pursuing. Should they have given CW a free lunch  Or a GC for a free lunch upon a return visit  Doesn't matter what they should have done as they did nothing - the bill arrived and was paid as expected.All in all, it was not a great food experience.  I don't think we will be returning for lunch anytime soon. Was it a bad day for the kitchen  Did we arrive before they were really ready to serve lunch  Not sure but, either way, when you spend $25 plus tip for lunch, I think there are better places to drop it.  Pity the kitchen staff cannot live up to the restaurant's name.",2024-01-08 00:41:21

I had stopped in to this place with friends to have a drink, and despite being a little put off by the servers, I came back because they usually have a really nice selection of beers.  My first mistake was to order anything from the kitchen.  My second mistake was to take my wife there and meet with some friends, and order something from the kitchen.  Bottom line - the kitchen, the people who plan the menu, the wait staff, and probably the kitchen manager are basically clueless about food and food service.  If you want to try an unusual beer that you have never tried before (beware, some of them are pretty nasty and they no longer seem to want to give you a ""sample"" cup before you order) and you don't mind spending a LOT of money for an unusual beer, by all means stop by and check out.

I've had terrible experiences on 2 occasions(i walked out the first time and was forced to go the 2nd time)simply because management wants to be difficult. Rather than satisfying and building a loyal customer, they would rather screw their customers out of their money.  I guess it makes sense since I imagine no right minded person would go back a 2nd time, so they may as well get what they can on your first visit. Charging a party of 3 the price of a party of 4 makes no sense. At min. I should have received the 4th meal to go or been served posrtions for 4 people...not just get robbed of $43. If your not going to follow your fine print on Gift certs, then you shouldn't have it. The food was just Okay... I have definitely had better like food for a the same price or even less. I absolutely will not go back to this place.

265,davidbrown@protonmail.com,"The real deal...it's my ""Lotus of Siam"" of Vietnamese food...(at least here in Vegas...)My husband, the chef, eats here weekly with the boys from the kitchen and a few chef buddies from around town...They always sit in Ben's section - he makes great recommendations when Chef is feeling like having more than 11 (pho) and some orange chicken (hey it's usually 2am so he's entitled to be a creature of habit of sorts...).  Since I work more normal hours, I rarely meet him -- but when I can, it's always a treat...Last night, since I had the day off today, we went -- and it was yummy!  Ben was there and in addition to my usual can't miss dish (the salt and pepper calamari -- with jalapeno, green onions and crispy garlic), he suggested the Vietnamese salad with chicken -- it was brilliant!  Crispy cabbage, crunchy crushed peanuts, fried shallot rings, crispy garlic , tender pulled chicken, cilantro and a misoginger dressing that was perfect -- I love salads that are balanced in flavor, texture and acidity... he said they make it with duck, beef, shrimp, calamari, just about every protein they have in house...  Then he suggested we try the lamb -- I know...lamb at Pho  It was phenomenal -- tender lamb chops with Chinese spices, grilled to medium rare...over a cold, crispy romaine salad -- again another great dressing -- not sure about ingredients in this one though...Then he told us they had venison...but by the time he got back with sauces it was 86d, so he ordered the beef for us.  Out came a large, smoking hot black river rock -- a plate of sliced beef, with chunks of butter and limes.   He melted the butter on the stone, then put the beef on it and we cooked it to our degree of doneness -- squeeze of lime -- a dip in the sauce, and it was tender and delicious and took seconds.   That rock wasn't going to cool down anytime soon...Last night, the spring rolls weren't that great, and the dumplings were tough -- so I'll avoid them next time.  Hey, I can't eat everything...so it's fine with me -- but I'm still looking for Vegas' best potstickers... But for a chef to come, and when he's in the mood, for the experience to be totally different -- that many think is just same ol, same ol --  and for us to be treated like royalty (uh, we're not Asian...), is a real treat.  I've been in a few times by myself for a quick lunch -- and they always remember me.  It's nice because I'm not the kind of regular that I'd love to be...",2024-01-31 17:36:01
115,rmiller@hotmail.com,"While rethinking a trip I took to Myanmar a few years back, I really don't remember eating anything typically Burmese. Just chicken, rice and fish really. After eating here, it made me want to go back and see what I missed.I came by here last night on a whim with some family members not really knowing what to expect. Starting off, we ordered samosas which were good, but not great. For our main courses we had Beef Marsala and the Chicken Basil with jasmine rice. The portions weren't huge, but it was just enough to split three ways and not feel overly full. Those two dishes were made up one of the best tasting meals I've had in a long time. Describing the food and the flavor is hard to do because it's not as hot as Thai, not as spicy as Indian, but definitely not Chinese. It's kind of this weird ""it's like this, but not like that"" mix which makes sense given Myanmar's geographical location. Regardless, it's some of the better tasting food I've had in Scottsdale and is surprisingly well-priced. If you've ever had an ABC drink, they have a desert that's alot like that. I forget the name, but it was the perfect way to end the whole meal. The mango-raspberry sorbet was also ridiculously good as well.",2024-01-31 17:50:37
93,olivia.martinez@hotmail.com,"I've tried to give this McDonalds a chance but my patience has run out. The only reason why I came here as much as I did is because I like the $1 iced coffees. But it's not even worth it. This McDonalds is poo and so is most of the staff. Whenever I want to go through the drive-thru I can't because there is a line of cars wrapped half away around the building. And even when the line is shorter there's always a hold up of some sort. So most of the time I just park and go inside the restaurant. Today was a horrible day. I ordered an iced coffee (no cream or sugar) and a chocolate chip cookie. It only takes 30 seconds to fill a cup with coffee and 30 seconds to take a cookie out of the case. I waited 10 minutes!! Sorry but that's too long just to get a coffee and a cookie! It's not like I ordered a meal! During that time I saw people come in after me and get their milkshakes and iced coffees within two minutes! WTH! I told the petite sleepy eyed cashier I wanted my money back! Her eyes opened wide in surprise, like I really woke her up or something. She said,""Youre the one who ordered the iced coffee I can get it for you!"" For real She was the one who took my order! I told her I waited too long and I just want my money back. The manager offered to make my iced coffee, but  I refused because I had just had enough.There are *few* employees there who work hard but everyone else is dragging their feet. There is no organization or teamwork, everyone is scrabbling. It looks like none of them want to be there. I used to work in fast food and I know it sucks, but come on!I'm sorry but I can't recommend this Mcdonalds. It's poo. I'm not coming back here anymore.

91,robert.brown59@hotmail.com,"Moroccan food in Phoenix What How had I been working a mile down the street for a year and a half without trying this placeWell, I finally stopped by. It's a little confusing when you walk in, because it's really a small operation... Didn't know whether to just pick a table, or let the lady working there seat me, or what. But once I got situated, things started getting a little more relaxed.The menu is impressive indeed, with a good six or seven dishes that were all calling my name. I ended up opting for the lamb tangine with soup and rice, and the lemonade. The lemonade is as good as any delicious lemonade you'll find at a Mediterranean place, by which I mean it actually tastes kinda like lemon.  I like that they make it a little tart - the same way they do it at my favorite Lebanese places.The soup was a tomato based soup with carrots, chickpeas, lentils, spices, and possibly some other things. It's OK, I'm not a huge fan of that kind of soup, but it went down nicely, even on a 110 degree day.Of course the tangine was what I was looking forward to most - the only way I can describe it is succulent. The lamb is fall-off-the-bone tender, and presumably cooked in the clay pot after which it is named, along with some figs and an aromatic sauce. To complete the meal, I had some baklava for dessert. I figured I might as well try it, since I hadn't had baklava in awhile. It was delicious. It was drizzled in a light syrup, and wasn't quite as overwhelmingly rich as baklava can be sometimes. This is definitely a place where you can expect to relax - it's a small operation. But just savor it, you're in Morocco!",2024-02-03 10:14:51

8,robert991@hotmail.com,"It has taken me a long time to write this review.  This was one of my first favorite restaurant in Las Vegas when we were thinking of moving here a couple of years ago.  I had been and tried everything and loved it. Then my wife,  our friend that introduced it to us, and I went together.  The food was great,  we're trying everything.  My wife ordered a Turkish Coffee,  she was drinking it and enjoying it.  All of sudden she got very quiet.  I asked her what was wrong.  She pointed to her coffee cup.  I looked into it,  and thought I saw a coffee bean.  I said so.  She told me to look again,  which I did.  There was a cockroach cooked in the coffee. My wife was nauseated. We called over the waitress, showed it to her, and here is the part that earned the one star, she did not even really react! She just said she will take the price of the coffee off the bill! And then we started really looking around and saw two more dead cockroaches.I am not saying she should have brought the owner out, told the chef, had him prostrate himself begging his forgiveness or anything.

147,sdavis@outlook.com,"Pushiest staff I've ever encountered.  My wife and I recently purchased a new home, and had LOTS of spaces to furnish.  We spent many weekends hitting up the furniture stores along Scottsdale Road, and before going in to Thomasville we looked at their online selection and were impressed.  So... we headed to the store.We were used to the introductions upon entering furniture stores by the sales associates, followed by the occasional ""how are you doing"" and ""can I help you with anything""s.  But the salesman that greeted us here WOULDN'T LEAVE US ALONE.  He shadowed us as we walked throughout the entier store, commenting on EVERY SINGLE THING WE STOPPED TO LOOK AT.  My wife and I had ZERO opportunity to chat amongst ourselves during the entire 20-30 minutes we were in the store.  We consistently made eye contact with each other, trying to figure out how we were going to squirm away from this guy.  Finally, we escaped and needless to say, never went back or bought anything.  It's unfortunate, since their selection actually was good and we may have very well bought some major items from them.  Now, we just laugh every time we drive past the store and talk about the salesman in there that we'll never forget.",2024-02-20 08:02:00

7,robert.jones@gmail.com,"My man loves beer, but we both hate bars. That's why this classy little beauty less than a mile away from our house was a definite must-try. Let me begin the review by letting you know, up front, that we really enjoyed everything about the place. Minimal complaints! We visited Sonora on a Friday at around 7:00...there were a few parking spots left in what is really a very ample parking lot for downtown Phoenix. I mean, damn! There must be at least 20 spaces. I'm a worrier and I stress out about things like, ""WHERE WILL WE PARK!"" before I go anywhere. I know...I know. So, I was pleased to see that I needn't have gifted myself with an ulcer over where we could park without getting towed or ending up on blocks. Sonora Brewhouse is comprised of two buildings, joined by an outside dining area between them. The building you first walk into, (the older building, I perhaps incorrectly surmised), is small and was filled with many jovial patrons on our visit. We wouldn't have wanted to sit at the bar, but we couldn't have, anyway! It was completely full, as were almost all of the booths and tables. We made our way to the outside seating area, and were about to sit down when we noticed the second building...right on the other side of the outdoor seating. We ventured in, and it was much less full than the other building, but several times as noisy. Oh, well. We sat down and surveyed our new environs. I've read several reviews on here vaguely bashing the ambiance of the restaurant - I found nothing to complain about. Then again, I like faux exposed-brick walls and dark wood paneling. ""Duly noted."" Alright, cool. Thanks. I also liked the kind of fun, amateurish canvas paintings of the images they pair with each of their beers that are strewn about said exposed-brick walls. Plasma TVs abound, which I hate, but I know people eat that technology crap up so I guess it's worth mentioning. Our waitress was just friendly enough, avoided all bitchiness, and was on top of things without being obnoxious. In other words, perfect. My boyfriend ordered the pale ale, (I think it's called The Stinger Something like that), and I, not a beer drinker in the slightest, decided to throw caution and personal preference to the wind and have a Vanilla Porter. Because, you know. It would taste like vanilla. And...vanilla is for girls. Like me. That don't drink beer. My boyfriend chuckled at this logic, and told me I wouldn't like it and that I didn't know what I was ordering. ... Yep. Just about right. As far as beer goes, I did like the kind of bitter and still beer-like hint of baked goods flavor, but it was not anything like I cluelessly imagined. I still drank it! My boyfriend really enjoyed his pale ale with no criticisms. My boyfriend ordered the Tavern Steak with steamed vegetables and steak fries, and I ordered the Santa Fe Chicken Sandwich with the kettle chipschipotle ketchup. We were both very pleased with our entrees...the jalapeno butter () on the steak is pretty tasty. As for the sandwich, I'll eat anything if it is slathered in guacamole. The steak fries were as good as steak fries ever are, and the kettle chips are as good as all of the other reviews have told you. I don't eat potato chips and I hate ketchup, but I loved the combination here. Fun tip: I tried putting some of the chipotle ketchup on my sandwich, and it tasted really gross. Maybe limit your use of the ketchup to its intended, menu-endorsed purpose. When we were done, we had no problem getting the bill, paying the bill, and getting out. The parking lot was completely full when we left, and there were two cars jockeying for our spot. That was probably around 8:00 - 8:30 PM, so if you're a damaged individual like me who finds cause to stress about parking, go earlier than that. There were a lot of other options on the menu that sounded like they might be on the ""delicious"" side. If you are like us, and not into the drama-filled 20-something bar scene downtown, this might be a nice alternative. It's so close, and we were both really down with the experience...we will definitely be back.",2024-02-28 02:05:33

They're only open fri-sun and they've started their summer hours which is 7am-1pm. Makes sense since I don't think anyone would like to be out in the summer heat mid-afternoon. Once getting into check-in, if you're a first timer to the range, they will make you watch a video which covers range safety and rules. After you're done watching the video, you pay $7 and you're off. They also rent scopes, ear muffs, and safety glasses. Also, they will give you a punch card. On your 5th visit, your range time will be free that day! So that's pretty awesome. They also sell a membership which is $75 (I think, its around there Lol) for an entire year. Being a member let's you come to the range without paying a entry fee which is very useful especially for me because I'm out there every weekend.I'm so happy to have a range near me.

230,oliviabrown@protonmail.com,"Kosher Pigswich with Dickfries and Ballzslaw!!!Ladies and Gents, to comprehend what I am about to lay upon you I feel it's only right that I paint a picture of the womb from whence it came. Welcome to Da Burgh, Ahhrn City --An old east coast city in Southwestern Pennsylvania, situated on the hills and valleys carved out by the Allegheny, Ohio, and Monongahela.  It rains a good deal here.  The city was built by many Eastern Europeans, some Italian, and some German immigrants who worked their asses off in the steel mills years ago.  Currently, Pittsburgh is much less blue-collar, but it still maintains much of rough blue-collar charm.  People here are genuine, love their football, beer, cigarettes (Marlboros and Camels not Parliament Lights), and facial hair (usually unkempt ones with neck beardage or the cookie duster mustaches often popular with middle-aged men with last names ending in ""ski"".)Only out of a city such as Pittsburgh, could the Primanti Bros. Sandwich become a legendary food.A Primanti Bros. Sandwich starts with thick slice of homemade bread, then the usual suspects of meats, cheeses, french fries are put on top, and then sweet & sour slaw is slung on top of that, and finally a tomato, and another piece of thick homemade bread.  The entire creation is plopped down flimsy piece of cooking parchment and shoved across the counter your way.  It's a huge toppling sloppy mess.  The only way to fit the damn thing in your mug is too smash it down before you bite in.  Whatever your modus operandi for eating a Primanti, there just ain't a way to eat it with dignity and still eat it right.If you're having trouble visualizing this, check out their website. Besides their city menu has the 2 best seller indicated and yet oddly enough absolutely no mention whatsoever of the 1 or 3 primantibrothers.comThe true yinzer sandwich option that I recommend is the Kolbassi and Cheese.  The Kolbassi is split open and dropped into the fryer.  Yes, a deep fried sausage topped with cheese, fries, and slaw.  The grease just glistening from the singed flesh as it absorbs into the thick white bread (dignity is overrated anyway). Make sure yinz warsh it dahn wit ah cold ahhrn city, en'at.  (translation: Make sure you wash it down with a cold Iron City Beer and that.)Primanti Bros. is definitely not diet food, but most definitely a 100% genuine Pittsburgh food.  It is disgusting in all the right ways.I leave you with the apt lyrics of South Carey. ""Where they don't pour steel, but the kids are real. But why do they all have beards (beers) It's Pittsburgh, Go Steelers Pittsburgh.""",2024-03-07 12:47:50

But MAN, it's pretty freaking big. Tons of supplies, including books and software.  They also carry Montana spray paint and comicmanga supplies, so I feel like their selection is pretty comprehensive.

The only employee I could see in the entire restaurant was the bartender!After waiting for about 5, a girl came up, and asked how many in our party. I responded ""two of us, but is there a wait"" She responds, ""yes at least 10-15 minutes"".At this point I look around the restaurant, way more empty tables then full. Like David K stated, I understand the shifts and seating requirements in a restaurant, but customer service and perception is always 1.

278,michael290@gmail.com,"Ok, seriously, I gave this place 1 star but only because they have my favorite Irish Ale on tap - and they should because it's an Irish pub.  I suppose it would be an ""okay"" place if you want to hang out in a neighborhood bar and play pool andor video games and drink at a mediocre price.  I read on their white board that they have a live blues band a couple of nights a week (FriSat maybe), which, if they're decent, could be pretty cool.Anyway, let me walk you through my experience...It's Tuesday night and my friends want to go to a karaoke place.  Why they chose this place I will never know.  I was actually a little scared when we walked up.  Some of the patrons were outside smoking and they looked a little rough around the edges.  Now, I'm really not one to judge based solely on appearance, but...  I digress.The bar itself is laid back.  Wood paneling, some high tables, low tables, long bar with stools.  Plenty of room for big groups.  I would say there were a couple dozen people there which is pretty good for a Tuesday night.  I didn't visit the bathroom because I was scared to see what it looked like.The bartender was just ok.  I got my first drink (draft beer) pretty quickly.  However, when I went up to the bar for a second beer, the bartender was nowhere to be found.  I stood there for about 10 minutes.  She finally came back in after her smoke break and poured me a beer.  I still tipped her because that's how I roll.The karaoke was AWFUL.  The song selection was large, but I couldn't seem to find any of my regular songs, which are popular hip-hop songs from the current decade.  If you're into singing Limp Bizkit, Metallica, Pantera and other songs from way back in the day, this place is definitely for you.  You will be entertained by middle-aged obese men moshing next to their table and growling into the microphone, while the host either sings uninvited backup or makes out with her boyfriend.  But that's not even the best part.My friends and I wanted to sing a specific song and the host overheard us.  She said cool.  We tipped her (heavily) so she would move us up in the rotation.  We waited about 20 minutes.  Then, she came over and said she didn't have that song.  Surprise.  We asked her to move our other songs up in the rotation and she said no problem, but she did ask me to change my selection () for some reason.  I didn't and I really wish I could have gotten my money back.It's the most ridiculous karaoke experience I have ever had in my life and I won't be repeating it... ever.

15,emma.smith55@hotmail.com,"This is in response to the condescending owner of Genghis Grill.  Unfortunely for you, I'm a bit more educated than your average diner.  I am a registered dietitian and I am smart enough to know the your comments on my initial review are misleading to your other customers.  First off, I have a 30 minute lunch break therefore I dont have time to drive to your restaurant and sit there for 45 minutes.  But I understand many people have 1 hour lunch breaks and they may have time for your restaurant.  This is why I chose YC's because I can get in and out of there on my time schedule.Your goober sauces are more unhealthy than most sauces with the consistancy of water.  The only way sauces get that thick consistency is being made with excessive sugar andor fat just like BBQ sauce and mayo.  Anyone who knows anything about nutrition and asian dishes should know that ""Kung Pao"" sauce is one of the most calorically dense sauces.  This goes for any asian restaurant not just YC's- along with other thick sauces like General Tso and Sweet & Sour.  I could really care less about these YC's recipes considering I always make my own as many people do.   I do not want a place that pre-makes the sauces for me.Your comparison is clearly ridiculous considering the portion size you are comparing must be dramatically different.  YC's does not specify a serving size.  Neither do you!  Genghis Grill Serving Size = 0.5 ,1, or 2.  What does this mean g oz tsp tbs cup  Not exactly what I'd call legitimate.   YC's charges .50 cents for a take-out box not $1.  I was charged 9.99 for lunch on a weekday for a to-go order.  So if your lunch is supposed to cost 8.99 well then you do the math.You only solidified my decision to NEVER GO BACK with your rude response.  I have only ever rated a restaurant with 1 star twice.  I usually rate generously.  My initial review was my honest opinion.  I had nothing against Genhis Grill- it just wasn't for me.  Now that you have responded this way- I will now go to the extent to letting friends and coworkers about the situation.

Here goes:My fellow students and I had organized a fundraiser to be held at R.M. We were raffling off some of our artwork and had ordered a substantial amount of food because we were expecting 50+ guests. Around 8:30pm, there was an AWFUL stench that filled the bar area, followed by a watery mist that began to fall from the ceiling along the west wall of tables. There were a number of people sitting in this area (myself included), who were covered in this putrid water (I had to go home and shower!!!). The food we ordered which was on a nearby table, was also covered. I alerted the manager who said to me ""It must be our pipes again."" Again This has happened to other customers The manager then called the fire department in to inspect the pipes running along the ceiling, while our guests (those who were left) crowded awkwardly around the bar.  The manager took no action in remedying the situation. Our food was NOT replaced, and the water on the tables and chairs was NOT wiped up, so that the guests could resume sitting. The artwork that was hanging on the wall was also damaged by the water, and was NOT compensated for. Radio Maria had quoted us for the cost of food prior to the event, but when we received our bill, it was over twice what they had quoted. Worse yet, the manager only refunded us the cost of one cheese plate. Thanks. You're swell.  This matter is still not resolved as the owners of Radio Maria seem to think they owe us nothing.

Everyone at the shop was always very nice and they worked above and beyond with our busy schedules to make sure that we were certified in time for a cruise we had planned. Everything went very smoothly and Bill worked hard to alleviate various concerns we had as the course progressed and made sure we were completely prepared at the end. I was a little skeptical about getting certified in the desert, but was impressed by Lake Mead (even if my expectations were a little low to begin with).

The ""sea food plate"", a $12 lunch entree, came with ONE scallop, THREE tiny shrimps and a piece of dried up fish smaller than the size of two quarters. We were all so hungry after the meal we had to go to another restaurant for more food. When I mentioned my poor experience with the manager on duty, he started to make excuses and argue with me. He didn't even bother to apologize. Bad food, bad service. I will never return to this restaurant again. Not for lunch, not for dinner, not for drinks, not for salsa, not for anything.

262,david.martinez@gmail.com,"When my well traveled cousin came to visit in Madison before departing for the Peace Corps (2 years in rural Guatemala) I scrambled to find a dining experience ethnic enough for her tastes.   I actually heard a lot about this place and since I didn't know what Peruvian was, I took that to mean it would more than suffice.  I used to dine at this location quite frequently as a freshman when it was a hole in the wall Chinese restaurant, so I was amazed at how the interior was turned around.  We had dinner here and the candle light bounced warmly off the yummy mango colored walls.  We were led to a cozy corner of the restaurant and was greeted by an attentive server.  Not sure what to order, we asked his opinion and discovered his thorough knowledge of the menu.  I ended up ordering the lamb while my cousin opted for the seafood dish and a chicken cheese dish.  We ate how we were raised--sharing en trees--and I found each plate to be delectable.  The lamb was so succulent, each bite so rich and hearty my mouth watered for more.  The seafood dish (which was recommended) was done to perfection--shrimp plump and juicy, King Crab legs already cut.  My favorite was the chicken dish which had an interesting cheese crumb outside layer.  The sides made out from corn were rich in flavor.  Overall this was quite an interesting dining experience.  I've been having pangs for the chicken and surprisingly the lamb ever since.  Though I'm not familiar with Peruvian cuisine, my taste buds tell me this is as true as it gets!",2024-04-26 18:24:00

I was there on opening day and back again to scope it out some more!For those not in the know: What Is Poutine  Well, the classic French-Canadian dish has fries, topped with gravy and cheese curds.This Traditional poutine is available here at Smoke's for purists, but the chain's claim to fame is giving poutine the rock-star treatment by variations to the standard poutine with a number of delicious toppings that take the dish from merely stratospheric to out-of-this-world.As an example, take my favourite option: The Country Style poutine which piles on chicken, bacon, mushrooms & caramelized onions as tasty toppings on the fresh-cut fries from Smoke's own potatoes and specialty gravy.  First it's salty and there's the squeaky cheese curds, then you get the smokiness from the bacon, then again you get a hit of sweetness from the caramelized onions.  In the end you have bite-after bite of poutine goodness.Not a sit down place, the take-out service here was fast and friendly, with a bit of a wait each time... even though it has just recently started, this location already has a lot of fans!",2024-04-26 22:58:58

Then we find out that after we had nicely split the tab for them (even adding in an extra $10 on top of the grat because we were too lazy to re-do the math) that they wouldn't split the check In the time we argued about it, you could have run the 3 credit cards we had and been done with it.Had to argue with the manager (who was completely unhelpful, with one of the waiters standing behind her and being rude to me for backup) for 10 minutes and they didn't give us an inch.

274,jamesbrown@outlook.com,"Interesting the reviews here are less than stellar already. I would normally not review a chain retail store, but the service I received today just really got my blood boiling.I will state, as I always do in these types of situations, that I have worked many years in retail. I know what you're supposed to do. I know the ways I've displayed exemplary service and I know the ways I've slacked off. I get it, I really do.So I'm in the store early. Hardly any people in there. Weird for the Semi-Annual Sale time of year. Usually it doesn't matter what time you're there during the sale, it's always busy. I went through my usual bins and picked up a mess of undies and bras. Since no one was at the check out counter and I needed a spot to go through things, I set them down and started to try and chat with the sales chick. I actually always like to do this, just to shoot the breeze, but also to get their opinions on items I'm buying. The girl behind the counter was having non of this though.I asked her about a bra and she said she didn't know about that one, but said it should work. I understand, you can't try them all. But the thing that really irked me was that she was definitely not hiding her annoyance at me setting down my things on the counter. I even looked back to make sure there were no people checking out behind me. Ghost town. Tumbleweed rolled by. No one.So I'm going through my stuff and separating what I want and don't want and she's sighing and grabbing things saying ""Soooo, you DON'T want these"" Um, I'm not asking you to help me sort things. I'm not holding up a line. I'm just trying to not spend $$$ on an accidental XS pair of undies that got mixed in! After that, it's not exactly what she said, but how she acted. I have never felt more uncomfortable in a retail store before. I ended up grabbing my discards and putting them back myself (which I really don't mind doing, but after she huffed and puffed, I didn't even want to deal with her). The thing is, I was nice the entire time. I don't expect you to sit there and be sugary sweet either. Just do what you were hired to do. Be nice and sell some bras. If you come to work in a bad mood, the real world is not going to give you a hug. Suck it up and do your job or work where you don't have to talk to anyone else ever.",2024-05-02 04:16:28

293,michaeldavis@outlook.com,"Horrendous food - like someone who has never cooked before tried to recreate German delicacies using only their imagination and ingredients from the supermarket in the bad part of town.I ordered beef rouladen with cabbage and bacon, the beef was tough, the cabbage tasted like it came out of a can, and the brown sauce covering it all was like something the worst Chinese food restaurant in Nebraska would put on its chicken and broccoli. A floppy  uncooked piece of bacon found floating in this sauce was nausea inducing. The waiter, who could see how uncomfortable I was took it away and I ordered potato pancakes, feeling relatively confident that any restaurant can handle latkes. Another disaster - that I ate because I was two beers deep at that point - greasy, soggy giant discs of grated potato that had a raw taste and texture. If it weren't for the generous amount of sour cream and apple sauce - which I have to assume weren't made in house - I would have sent those back too. As is after eating their potato pancakes I went to another restaurant to have an actual meal, because I had been made joyless and despondent by Penn Brewery's failure to accomplish the most simple kitchen tasks. The beer is okay, not nearly as good as Church Brew Works and definitely not memorable considering the competitive landscape in the world of craft brewing - and I say that not even having traveled to that many breweryrestaurants, so even on its home turf Penn beer is forgettable. The service was appropriately apologetic considering the garbage plated that night and the space itself is well laid out and attractive. As is I would never go back, I might be tempted if I had strict assurances that the current management and culinary team were thrown out ala Kitchen Nightmares but even then I would need to see a good review.

Our reservation was for 7PM, and we got there at 6:55PM. The disgruntled lady tells us to sit in the lobby until it's closer to 7PM... Since when did showing up a few minutes early become a nuisance Moving forward, we headed towards the lobby to find eight people also waiting to be seated.

It wasn't great, but it wasn't horrible either.  That was the highlight of the eveningWhile waiting for the main dishes to arrive, it got extremely cold in the restaurant. We hear the staff complaining about the temperature, and then we see another couple complaining to the host about how cold it was on their side of the room. Finally, dinner arrives... I ordered the wild boar cooked to medium rare. It tasted medium-well to well done. The waiter stated that this dish comes with five large medallions, but looking at the dish, there were thinly shaved bits of meat. This dish reminded me of the over-cooked roast beef that my dad used to make when we were kids (which I hated, by the way). My wife ordered the braised short ribs which tasted like something that came out of a microwave. She tells me, ""For the price of this meal, I'd rather eat a microwaveable meal."" I tried a piece of the short ribs thinking it couldn't be that bad... WRONG. The short ribs were chewy, stringy, and although it was covered in sauce, it was DRY. We hardly put a dent in our meal. While waiting for our missing waiter, we noticed that the restaurant was starting to get really warm - similar to a gym. We both started laughing at how horrible everything had been. We were finally able to flag down the waiter for our check. He never once asked us how our meal was - even after seeing our plates were more than half full. Anyway, the moral of the story is: Don't waste your money here. Or perhaps call in advance to make sure Vincent is working. While waiting for our car, the valet guy said, ""Vincent is on vacation. His food is phenomenal, but when he's not here, we hear customer complaints."" Maybe this guy is right, and Vincent's food is out-of-this-world; however, based on the service alone, I will not even bother coming back. No second chances for this place - no thanks!",2024-05-24 20:44:22

But that did not make up for the runs I had after consuming 34 of the bowl...The won ton egg noodle soup was the most bland I've ever had - and I had pretty high expectations since this is rated 4 stars on Yelp - disappointing.

255,michaelbrown@protonmail.com,"I'm going to tell you the end of this restaurant horror story and then you can decide for yourself if you'd like to read the rest or have had enough. ReadyAs my friend and I are exiting Mallorca, the manager, who is shoveling food into his face at the bar, turns and says ""Sorry for the trouble girls..."" and spits his food all over us. Now, let's bring it back to the beginning, if you're so inclined. Upon recommendations, a passion for Spanish cuisine and armed with a groupon, my  friend and I decided to try Mallorca last Saturday evening. We were greeted by eager, formal wait staff and were promptly seated. The dining room was ugly, out dated, and several shades of dark puke green. The plaster had multiple holes and the wall paper was water damaged and peeling away. Aesthetics aside, we ordered the Sangria right away from hearing wonderful things and we were not disappointed.For an appetizer we ordered the special that day, octopus. It arrived quickly. It wasn't bad. I've had better, but it tasted fresh and seemed to be carefully prepared and the presentation was eye catching. For our main course, I badly desired the Paella Valencia. As a long time fan of SpanishSouth American culinary specialties, I was dying for a good paella! Our Paella Valencia arrived quickly. Excited about the paella, we barely noticed the small dish of random vegetables and the dish of potato chips they placed on the table (ummm thanks... how classy...and authentic...). As we scooped paella onto our plates and eagerly began to dig in, I barely had time to fully absorb the blandness of the dish when I noticed a man's HAIR pressed into my chorizo. I flagged over the bus boy who was leaning miserably against the wall. ""Hi, um, I have a hair in my Paella.""Bus boy: ""Oh! Um. Let me get your waiter.""Our waiter promptly marched over and began collecting all of our dishes. I tried to speak to him, ""I'm extremely surprised to find this hair in the food.""Waiter in his strong accent, ""Yes, ma'am, disappointing. But these things happen.""Wait. What""Yes, I realize these ""things"" can happen, but it shouldn't, not in this fine restaurant."" But he was gone before I could fully defend myself.Then we waited. And waited. And waited. No one came out to apologize. No one asked us if we needed anything. So I flagged the bus boy over again. ""Hi, is your manager around""Bus boy: ""Yes.""  Pause. ""Do you want me to get him"" No. I just want to know where he is. Me: ""Um. Yes, please get him.""The manager visits us for the first and ONLY time. He greets us with a look that says ""What do you want"" I explained our little problem to him. Manager: ""These things happen. ""Seriously SERIOUSLY Me: ""Look, your restaurant comes highly recommended. I had high expectations and did not expect to find a hair in my paella..."" Practically interrupting me he continues ""Yes, we have a fine restaurant. I have been in the business many years. These things just happen.""Me (getting annoyed now with the lack of apology): ""Do they wear hair nets in the kitchen""Manger: ""Yes, of course. Besides, we have no women in the kitchen.""SERIOUSLY Not only is that SEXIST, I had to inform him that is was NOT  a woman's hair, but rather a short black hair that turned gray on the end, much like his own hair, and that it was PRESSED INTO MY CHORIZO WHICH I SCOOPED OUT OF THE PAELLA FROM UNDER RICE. But, he clearly didn't want to hear it and walked away mumbling something that sounded like ""I'm disappointed."" Then our second paella arrived. Our waiter apologized (finally) for the hair, only to proceed to tell us that ""This can happen easily. You could lift up your napkin and a hair could fall in.""Ugh...Am I out of line to hope and expect that wouldn't happen Is there some ninja going around and hiding hair all over the restaurant Do you have a shaggy dog folding your napkins The lobster, scallops, tiny micro sized shrimp all tasted the same: bland, frozen, overcooked, boring. The rice had no flavor and looked remarkably like the boxed paella rice that Goya sells. The chicken was dangerously undercooked- hard and pink. Needless to say, we had no appetite after all of this. It wasn't hard to flag my actual waiter over this time. He had been standing in a corner ten feet away from our table with other waiters staring and pointing at us and talking about us in Spanish. Even if the paella was decent, we couldn't eat it while being stared at. Waiter ""Would you like me to box this""Me: ""No. Just the check.""With a surprising twist, our waiter returned and informed us that this delightful meal would be on the house and then presented us with two shots of some sweet liquor. We left our waiter a rather generous tip and got up to leave, feeling slightly vindicated. We were chatting about the possibility of returning, when we met our manager at the bar on our exit...Mallorca, you finally blew it when your manager blew his food on us.",2024-05-31 10:01:42
162,david418@outlook.com,"This is the second time that my husband and I have stayed at this hotel.  Both experiences have been terrible.  The staff is very rude and does not go out of their way to smile or go the extra mile.  The decor is bright and nice, but it is not maintained very well.  The lobby could use a good cleaning.  Also, there is a $15day charge for parking at this hotel.  The location is great, you can walk to pretty much anywhere, but it is very noisy even on higher floors.  We were mostly disappointed because we got a double room for Valentine's day and when we asked to for a king room, J.J. told us that we had booked online so we got whatever they had.  We felt like we were treated as second rate citizens because we had booked online.  Then when we got to the room, the faucet was so loose it fell over.  It was fixed promptly, but made a bad first impression.  Neither time my husband and I have stayed at this hotel have we had a good experience.

Whether it's the overweight frat guy or the backwoods overly-tanned middle aged yokul...everyone is drunk; and everyone is f*cking annoying as all hell.-Dirty Water. I mean...seriously, I couldn't wait to take a bath once I left. Someone else in another review talked about getting a band-aid that was floating in the water stuck to them...doesn't surprise me.-Getting burnt. I don't care what anyone says...you can slather on SPF -1000 sunscreen every five minutes...you're gonna leave here hurting. Blistering summertime heat in AZ...floating down a river for hours and hours...common sense says this just isn't a great idea. -Scratching your ass on rocks. If you've been there you know about this...sometimes while floating, the water level gets a little low and you have to really make an effort to lift your ass out of the middle of the intertube to avoid jagged rocks beneath...or else pain awaits...if you don't heed this advice...sorry...you're leaving with a bloody asshole that day. Well...I could keep going here...Bottom Line: Just go to Sunsplash or Waterworld for God's sake...this place is not worth the hassle.

19,robert393@yahoo.com,"I took a party of 6 friends and co-workers there last week when attending a tradeshow in Vegas ... I will never do that again!Biggest issue:  The bill came and I noticed just about 30% added to the bill as ""tax"" ... yes, 30%!  When I asked the server about it, he said that that includes 18% as service fee and 8.1% as tax ... and that that is explained in the menu.  I have several issues with this:1. Shame on me for not reading the menu and the fine print ... my mistake, but if you are reading this review, you don't have to make this mistake.2. Why am I forced to leave an 18% tip  The tip is not at my discretion.  If the server is not helpful, I can't express myself in any way.  3. Why is listed as ""tax""  I bet you most people do not even see it and add tip on top of it automatically!!!  That is stealing!4. Now, it gets worse:  I asked the server that if there is an 18% service fee plus an 8.1% tax, that adds up to 26.1%.  So, why is there an almost 30% charge  They add 8.1% to the bill and then they add 18% tip on top of it.  So, the effective percentage for tip is higher than 18%.Food:  It was no special in any way.  I am very familiar with Persian food.  I have had it in many cities and many countries.  I look for Persian restaurants everywhere I go.  This restaurant is not bad but it is not good either.  The food in NO WAY justifies the prices they charge!  I had chicken with bones, and it was not cooked well.  For appetizer, we had tadig which the crispy rice that is cooked in the bottom of the pan, and we had it with two kinds of stew.  Tadig was good but not enough for 6 people.  Stews were OK, but again not special.Service:  It was OK.  The server was not really pleasant: smiling or welcoming.  He was not rude or anything, but I felt like we were bothering him being there.  And the place was not busy.  The service in NO WAY justified more than 18% in tip.  But think about it the guy didn't care because he knew he will get his tip any way.

152,michael341@gmail.com,"So it seems as though that my original review was omitted from public view either by Yelp or AMI Diamond & Jewelry. So here I am today re-posting my review about my ruined proposal plan with a pathetic attempt to resolve the issue. Originally posted 482014 - ""I took my Fiance's ring here to get re-sized smaller since the ring I bought was a couple sizes too large. I dropped off the ring on a Thursday and was told that it would be done by Saturday. I was pleased to hear the great news at this point because of the perfect timing for the proposal (planned proposal for Sunday). Saturday came around and I still have yet to get a call. I decided to go to the store and check on the status in person. Conveniently they were closed all weekend due to all staff being sick... I understand that people get sick, but the entire staff And no courtesy call to let me know that the ring will not be done on time I had no choice but to continue with the proposal empty handed and explain the careless error of the jewelers. If that was not enough, I finally got in contact with someone on Monday and was told that they will have it ready for pick up by Tuesday that week. At this point, that was anything but acceptable. I demanded that they either complete the job and return my ring or return my ring immediately and I will go elsewhere for assistance. I was eventually told that the ring was complete, but at an off site location and they will personally go get the ring and have it ready that evening. Finally... progress!! Not exactly.... I am then contacted back and told that I will have to meet them after hours and it would be delivered to me. I think this will be an acceptable resolution to this nightmare and provide some kind of customer satisfaction. I wait at the agreed upon location (Starbucks) and no one shows up. I call the number to the store and am told that he forgot that we were meeting and asked if I can go to the store to get the ring. I am infuriated at this point. I finally headed to the store and retrieved my ring, completed and re-sized correctly. I would imagine that at some point I would get a break on the charge because of the headache to get a ring re-sized... Nope, I am charged full price and not even a simple apology was given.

299,lisawilliams@gmail.com,I signed up with Yelp just to write this review. My wife and I moved to AZ recently and we were happy to find a place which sold Cuban and Puerto Rican food. All the dishes we ordered were disgusting!  The fried meat (carne frita) that she ate was dry and flavorless. The mofongo she had was unlike any other we have ever tried. She asked me to try and I just couldn't swallow it. We both love mofongo so that was very disappointing. It doesn't end there my dish was the Puerto Rican plate so I was excited and thought it would bring back some memories of my hometown but it only brought back nightmares. The rice with pigeon peas (arroz con gandules) had way too much tomato sauce... I can go on forever but would rather not. I will just jump to the desert. We thought maybe since the meal was so horrible maybe they could redeem themselves with an awesome flan. When we ordered the flan the waitress said they did not have the large portion but she  could give us the two smaller portions. We said OK but to our surprise the flan was so pale and the taste was so bland. I looked at it carefully and noticed that it had the recycling symbol on it. Who does that!!!  Come on really!  I'm done with this place. I would never eat at this restaurant even if they paid me. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone unless I hated them.,2024-06-13 07:32:54

Since I was in town visiting, it gave us the perfect excuse to go.I'm happy to report that the experience was most excellent at Great Wall and that it lived up to the hype.  Upon getting there, we were given a number to wait as the restaurant was completely full, there were probably 150+ people there dining, however, we were seated within 15 minutes.  As soon as we  sat down, the carts started rolling by with various plates of items to try.The pancake, shu mai, shrimp, duck, and sliced beef inside a wrapper are highly recommended, all were excellent.  I did have a bit of trouble taking the shrimp out of the steam container because their rice wrappers were sticking a bit, but that does happen.I would advise that if you have an allergy to shrimp that you make sure to ask the server what is in some of the items because they do come with shrimp, including their egg rolls.  Since my dad has a shrimp allergy we did have to watch for that.  I did want to try their egg rolls but I would have been the only one eating them, and they were big enough to make a meal in itself.The sliced duck was one of the best I have had at a restaurant, well cooked with crispy tasty skin, and not too many bones to get in the way, and very reasonably priced at $6.25 for a plate.  Most other Dim Sum plates are $2.25 or $3.15 so you can end up eating a lot for a very reasonable price.If you love Dim Sum and are willing to wait a few minutes for a table, but you will get fast service afterward, this really is the place you want to go to.

159,emma.garcia91@outlook.com,"We've been trying to use our Living Social deal to this place for a couple months now... we finally had the chance on Saturday night.  My take on Melting Pot has always been that the cheese and the dessert are awesome - but that I could pretty much do without the meat course in the middle.So we started with the spinach artichoke cheese fondue, which was really really good.  The wedge salad with bacon and peppercorn ranch, also good.  Then we got to the meat course.  Without turning this into a novel, we discovered that one of the shrimp that had been cooking in our broth fhad not been de-turded.  That's right, it had been cooking with the rest of our meat, in poo-broth.  So, there goes the appetite, and after bringing it up to the waiter - and his discussing it with the manager - they were ""gracious"" enough to take a $5 beer off our tab.I'm sorry, but serving poop to customers, should pretty much be a no-no.  Especially at those prices.  I kept thinking of the line from one of my favorite movies, The Jerk, ""You would think, at these prices, you could keep the POOP off the food!"".I digress... suffice it to say, we won't be going back to The Melting Pot.",2024-06-29 14:03:16

Beef, Chicken, Lamb, or Veggie in a Kabob or Kubideh Kabob.  2 stars = the smell.  When you walk into the restaurant, you know your food is going to taste good because the awesome BBQ smell!3 stars = fresh persian bread.  Yum!  It comes w all the entrees and they give you a nice big portion to eat with your food.  I love bread!4 stars = for the fixings that come w your entree; lemon, roasted tomato (great addition to your meat), fresh onion - especially because I love onion, and rice.  Rice could be a little more tastier.  5 stars = for the meat!  As soon as I took a bite, I was in heaven; the meat is so flavorful and so tasteful!  I loved every bite of my Beef Kubideh Kabob.  Such a simple kabob, but tasted to so good!  It was even good with the green salsa they provide.  Their entree portions are perfect!

37,michael.martinez20@protonmail.com,"Ugh... I got a plate with seisage, tofu scramble, and sundried tomato toast. My whole plate was entirely dry, chewy, and unpalatable. I had high hopes for the tofu scramble, especially after seeing positive reviews about it. But honestly... It tasted like nothing. I thought it'd be moister with a creamy consistency that might come from silken tofu, but it was hard, dry, and chewy. Hubby got a country burrito that was much better in comparison to my plate... But that might have been due to the fact that his whole plate was doused in gravy. Anything will taste better drenched in gravy. We think the gravy tastes like the powdered packet kind where you just add water. On top of all this service wasn't the greatest. I had to fish around for my own ketchup and they didn't even bother to ask me what kind of toast (3 options on the menu)I wanted when I ordered the toast option for my meal. Then they didn't bother to ask hubby if he wanted anything to drink after he had picked one of the $12 entrees that come with coffee or juice. We had to tell someone else to get it for us. Also they don't really wash their cups. There are 2 sink basins at the front where they just dunk the cups in one soapy basin then dunk the cups in a second water basin and then stack them next to the sink. It made me not want to drink my water even though I was thirsty. Good idea, but poorly executed food. I've had good vegan and vegetarian food before that's consisted of a lot of fresh greens, avocados, and more. For a vegetarian place, there was nothing green on our plates. This experience sadly fell enormously short of our expectations... Could've eaten at kaya or meat and potatoes for the same price.",2024-07-02 00:25:20

I got there and the food was indeed ready, but when I went to the counter to pay, the 10 year old boy (I know this is a family owned establishment but come on..) charged me $10 and change for a menu item that is advertised at $6.99. I asked the boy if this was correct and he said yes. So I paid for my three dramatically overpriced spring rolls and left. Once I got in the car and looked at the order they were completely wrong... Expecting the spring rolls to be the traditional vietnamese spring rolls with shrimp and pork, they were some sort of dark meat, messily wrapped concoction that is nothing similar to what was expected or what they have served there in the past.

Very limited selection of foods and what was on the buffet was cold and unappetizing.  Very sad excuse for a buffet brunch.  The corn muffins were dry and crunchy.  The fresh fruit on the buffet consisted of sections of red grapefruit and oranges.  There were no fresh veggies, no multigrain anything, no pasta salads, nothing at all interesting or healthy.  And the decaf coffee was horrible -- burnt tasting.  The only redeeming things were the made-to-order omelet station and the alcoholic drink that was included in the $14.99 price.

163,james.williams@outlook.com,"I don't think this business wants business.  They close at 7 on a Friday night.  I met up with my party out front at 6:30 (still hot and light out in July) at this place based on the great Yelp reviews.  We walked in and the place is hideous inside you can look into the messy, cluttered kitchen, there are maybe 4 very crappy little (think Winchell's Donuts from the 1970's) tables in the whole place and they made no use of their patio.  The lobby and dining room are the same space.  So needless to say, not really the place you want to meet with friends.  Not even a place you CAN meet with friends, the tables are pretty much for 2 people and there are only 4 of them.  Anyway, being optimists and since we were already there we walked in around 6:45 the woman was rude to us for being there 15 minutes until close.  I guess she wanted to get out of there so we were told she was closing and we could get a to go order if we wanted to stand around and wait.  It wasn't like there was any seating.  I looked at the fat guy and another person sitting around in the messy kitchen and took the rudeness of their upset over how ""late"" we showed up as my cue that we were not really wanted there so we left and ended up at Westgate.  We tried to support downtown and felt bad that we were denied.  FRIDAY NIGHT!!  Any restaurant should at least stay open until 9 on Friday and Saturday or at very least seat until their posted 7 close time.  We should have just gone to Hause Murphy's.

131,ewilliams@gmail.com,"Captain's Log Stardate: Circa 2004 - 2006-ish... I lived about an hour and a half outside of the city. Coming here was usually pretty exciting. (Here as in the city, not Silky's.) I had a friend who lived here in the East End and on the street I reside on now. Several times we found ourselves at Silky's Pub. I love the corner building, the way it looks out onto Liberty Ave. It looks so welcoming. Especially in the summer. Outdoor seating, always pretty well packed with people.I'll come right out and say that the crowd that frequents Silky's isn't my usual crowd, but unlike some bars I'd never had an issue with someone wanting to start a fight with us because we look like a bunch of dirty malcontents. This place is just not our usual dive bar.Thursday night my boyfriend texted me that he was there with a mutual friend. Living less than a city block from there I headed over. I needed a beer and some hockeyworld series action to distract me after the Halloween parade. It was as busy as usual. A few seats remaining and I managed to snag one right at the bar, front and center.I hate to say this because I don't remember this happening years ago when I went there. I was not even acknowledged. I get flagging down a bartender in a crazy busy bar in the South Side on a Friday night. I don't like it but I get it. This was a moderately steady Thursday night. I wasn't standing behind the people's sitting at the bar. I was the person sitting at the bar. There were two male bartenders both bartenders asked the guy next to me multiple times if he wanted anything else to drink. By ""multiple times"" I mean 6 or 8 times. The person sitting directly beside me. They wouldn't look at me. I tried to make eye contact with either of them and it was as if I wasn't even there. Eventually the boyfriend's beer emptied as well. This is about 20 minutes after I arrived. I've had people walk in and stand behind us and the bar tender or waitress was on them immediately. After another 5 minutes of the boyfriend's beer being perched precariously on the edge of the bar and the bartenders standing there chatting he had to ask the bartender for a refill and if I could have a drink.The bartender looks up at him, grabs his pint glass angrily from the bar and says, ""Oh, you wanted another"" Really I was so angry at that point that it took everything I had not to ask the guy what his issue was.  I later saw him drop a pint glass and stumble into something so many he was drunk.The food that other people ordered smelled and looked great. Even the seafoody bits which I normally hate smelling. The tv's are plentiful and newer. I just don't know if I'll ever get to go back and try the food as I hate being slighted by a business owner and treated as if my business isn't appreciated.",2024-07-12 20:41:09

Another example: my sister ordered what was described on the menu as grilled chicken with peanuts and raisins.  The dish came out covered in cheese.

I stood there for a good 15 minutes with maybe 5 people tops at the bar. The bartenders never once acknowledged me yet they did manage to make eye contact. They then all walked out from behind the bar and went outside. It took another ten minutes until finally the manager came over and served me. I am a bartender and I am appalled to see such people being employed at what seems like a decent place.

It is as close as I can define a ""Sports Pub"", with the tvs showing sports, but with the British Pub decor, and not spilling over the brim with sports fans.  They have good solid pub food which is tasty and with big portions.  The food is always above par and I don't ever think I've had something I wouldn't order again.  I even got a grilled cheese and loved it!!  There is a bit of sticker shock, when you see a sandwich for around 8 bucks, but the sides and the taste make up the difference.  They have some good beers on tap, and you can spend a pretty penny, or you can get a pitcher of Yeungling pretty cheap and just  hang out and play shuffleboard if you like.  The atmosphere is good and friendly, and they have tables outside in the summer.  The jukebox does leave many songs to question, but overall it is a good mix.

282,michael.martinez20@protonmail.com,"I stopped in here today and sampled the food and atmosphere. The owner (Tina, obviously) is one of the sweetest people I've ever met. The restaurant is small and cozy and eclectically decorated. The food - now, I've never really eaten Ethiopian food. Tina had to kind of give me a quick instruction on it. She put the plate down and my first instinct was to take a photo (and now I wish I had) - it was beautiful. She explained that she makes her own bread - it's a special sort of bread that's almost like a cross between pancake and a European fluffyspongy crumpet. Next to it is a smaller plate filled with sauce and meat and vegetables. It looked a little messy, so I looked around for silverware. Silver-where What No silverware I'm sure she had some, but she said I should eat with my fingers and told me how it works - using the bread to scoop up the meat and sauce. I had a bite of spicy chicken - OMG so good! Then I tried the ground beef - also OMG amazing!I took some home for my girlfriend who didn't even wait until I got inside the house - she met me in the garage and scarfed down a bunch of it. She also thought it was delicious. We're definitely going to have dinner here soon. I noticed a bunch of low reviews here and for the most part they are from people who didn't actually eat there or that bought an online coupon deal. I'm not going to bad mouth any daily deal site (sometimes they can help put a business on the map), but I can tell you that for a small business like this, it can be financially devastating doing a coupon or daily deal like this. Restaurant owners are asked to sell something for half price and then only get to keep half of that. It's safe to assume they lose money every time they do one. Also, they don't see any money from it for months. Also, the coupon customers often only show up someplace when there's a coupon involved. Restaurant owners aren't coached on how to get these customers to come back in to pay full price. And then to try to use an expired coupon and trash a tiny independent restaurant online when they won't accept it anymore - that's even more bad news for the restaurant owner. It just doesn't seem fair. I don't know. It seems like the opposite of supporting local to me. This restaurant is cute and charming and the owner is awesome. The food is incredible, and I'm a super picky eater who won't eat anything. I'm a fan of Ethiopian now. Can't wait to go back.",2024-07-27 01:54:04

To get to the bathroom she had to go through the kitchen and down a flight a stairs. When passing through the kitchen she saw raw chicken left out in the heat congealing in it's own blood.

201,jbrown@yahoo.com,"Yuck!It's almost embarrassing having this place exist in the Strip with so many tourists coming here.  That has to be how they're making their money because it's certainly not on their food or service.  Well, maybe it's the booze too...I don't even know where to begin.  Service was horrible.  The lunch took 2 hours.  On a leisurely Sunday that may be fine, but there was no leisure.  At least not with drinks not in hand until a 12 an hour after we sat down.  I'd say lunch was served another 12 to 45 minutes later.  It didn't matter though, I knew it wasn't going to be anything spectacular.  I'd heard rumors about the food.  I won't go into any details but I wouldn't trust some items on the menu.  I just played it safe and ordered a veggie salad.  The salad was in the entree section, so I assumed it would be a full size salad.  It was not.  It was a side salad with a handful of grilled veggies on top.  Nothing spectacular.  And a side salad at almost $11.  Not worth it.  If you are forced to stop in because you're dying of hunger, stick to a liquid diet:)",2024-08-01 00:53:49

I can think of few things as terrifyingly bad as raw shrimp, wrapped in raw bacon. Can you But alas, I live two blocks away and thought, well we will give it another shot. My sister saw on the website that there were fried oreo sundaes. We said ok what the hell. So we went down, and sat. And sat. And sat. Finally we started debating whether we needed to walk up to the bar and get menus or leave or what, and someone came over. We ordered waters while we checked out the beer selection, and waited for her to return so we could ask some menu questions, like where were the oreo sundaes ont he menu She dropped the waters and left. And left. And left. And never returned. Finally we left as well and went to the village pub down the street. MUCH better. :) I tried to give this place a second chance. I WANT to like this place, I can walk there in two minutes from my apartment! It says they have five dollar dinners, but we never go tot ask about them cause there was no server. The wings on the menu were 7 dollars, but there was sign that said five dollar wings...at the pizza place. However the pizza place, restaurant and bar are all one entity so I dont understand where we go for that deal. Oh and the oreo sundaes are a lie. :(",2024-08-02 18:25:21

The chef came out 2-3 times to try to kill it. he also used the word again, making me think this wasn't a new problem.

We were seated very quickly as a waitress was already walking to greet us as we walked into the door.  We sat down & were checked on very regularly by whom I assuming is one of the owners.  Real cool laid back kind of guy.  As per usual, we got an order of wings (wild flavor) & I had my mind all made up to try something different today off of the menu (usually eat a burger or London broil sandwich), but was told of two specials that both sounded incredible.  The first one, grilled cheese with hearty chicken stew, is what I had.  My friend and his brother had the other special, meatloaf w onions on rye bread.  Everything was tasty and great as always.  The wings are hands down some of my favorite anywhere.  My friend also got some crab soup which he said was very good.

169,sarah.martinez@gmail.com,"I really dislike writing reviews like this, but according to yelp's rating guide this is the best I could give them given what happened the night we had dinner there. I'll start off with rating how I would have rated the place up until what occurred at the end of the meal. The atmosphere is really cute and decorated like a little rural German pub. Our German friends came with us and said it was straight out of a 1960's little German town. We were seated promptly and service was pretty good. There were about 6 or so tables and just one woman serving so we waited a little bit but not bad. They had quite a few gluten free options which was nice. Their gravies are not made with flour, and a few of their entrees are g-free. The food was okay, I was really hoping to be more impressed. Our German friends thought the red cabbage was pretty good but were not big fans of their schnitzel or their sausage. The sausages were gluten free so I ordered the Knackwurst and my boyfriend had the Currywurst, we liked both of them. He didn't like the schnitzel he ordered (I couldn't have it since it had bread crumbs) and my cornish game hen had been fried and was really really dry inside. The cabbage and potato salad sides were pretty good. Prices for each were very reasonable and we also had a restaurant.com card. Okay so the one star reason. I was still finishing my plate when something happened that made me concerned about the hygienic nature of the restaurant. An insect of the worst type for a restaurant crawled out from behind the mustard on the side of the table and made its way to my plate. My boyfriend tried to kill it but if anyone has ever had to deal with these critters they know how fast they are and their ability to fly doesn't help either. It scurried around for about 10 mins until he finally got it. By this point I had excused myself to the bathroom... we all paid our checks quickly and left trying not to make a scene. So, while I wasn't super impressed with the food before this happened I still probably would have come back for the sausages but after what happened I'm a little concerned about the cleanliness so I have to recommend a no go to yelp viewers.",2024-08-15 15:13:33

87,sarahjones@outlook.com,"I'm simply not a fan of this place and don't plan on going back so let me explain why... Last fall, before a panthers game I came here and had a pretty decent lunch-I had a tasty buffalo chicken wrap with fries and two Bloody Mary's (yes it was one of those Sundays) and all was good. I left for the game with a decent memory of Presto. Fast forward to the new owners and disappointed is the best word that comes to mind. First, I met a co-worker for a quick lunch, which meant I wasn't hungover or imbibing, so it was a much more objective assessment. I paged through a menu that has a serious identity crisis from mediterranean to American to italian pasta dishes to typical bar food and settled on a chicken gyro sandwich...when in doubt, I always go the specialty cuisine. When it arrived it had tzatziki on the side (good) and some weird, greasy dressing drizzled inside (not good). To make things worse, after my first taste, I almost sent it back to say I ordered chicken, thinking they gave me fish...but them realized the consistency was chicken with a really bad taste. Nonetheless, I ate the pita bread and wilted greens I got for a side salad and split...with a stomach ache to follow.

Does anyone ever work here Every time i walk in theres like nobody working. i will see 2 girls at most and their always busy helping other people or ""pretending to look busy"" .. If i am lucky enough to get someones attention and speak to an associate there always so DAMN rude!!

Excuse me but its not my fault that your a middle aged woman working retail in a mall, so please change your attitude towards me and give me some service.2.

217,michaelrodriguez@yahoo.com,"I live around the corner and figured I'd give the place a try.  Since it is a cafe I assumed they would have a variety of tasty sandwiches to choose from.  Boy was I wrong.  They literally have 4 sandwiches to chose from and they are nearly identical.  3 pieces of bread, mayo, and egg are on everything.   They apparently think their clientele is made up of grade school children because they cut the crust off of the bread.  The sandwiches are pre-made, they just pulled it out of the fridge and gave me half.  Good luck saying ""no mayo"".  Who sells a sandwich by the half  It had 3 pieces of bread, a smearing of mayo with pimiento on one side, and a razor thin piece of cheese or ham in the other.  When I saw how lame the sandwich was I asked for an Empenada too but they told me 10 minutes to heat it up.  I wasn't waiting for that, I was hungry.  The sandwich was average and even though he gave me a card to get a free sandwich, I will not be going back.They sell smoothies if you are into that.  But, they have the name ""cafe"" in the title so that is how they will be judged.  Poor excuse for a sandwich, plus no variety, plus no substance, plus no selection equals a disaster of a place.  Drink options are bottled soda or bottled water.  After eating the 3 bite sandwich (it literally could have been smashed into 1 bite) in the car before pulling out of the parking lot I immediately wondered where I was going to get lunch.  That is a bad sign.  There are way to many good places with variety, value, and freshness in the area to waste your time trying this place out.",2024-08-24 02:19:51

The staff and owners are really great and welcoming and have been there for a long time so they never hesitate to introduce people making you feel right at home.The beer selection is varied enough for most people to find a pint, but they specialize in Scotch.  They have the biggest selection I have seen in Montreal, and they have regular events, sponsored by companies for tastings.  One of these was attended by my hubby and Poodle, he (Kobe the poodle) ended up with a Jameson t-shirt, and a photo on their website.  Other important events include the St Patrick's day celebrations.  The decor of the new place is more modern than pub-by, and has more of an upscale look, but the warmth for which they are known is still the key attribute.",2024-09-18 23:17:18

I compare alot of things to Chicago and this is one area where Charlotte blows chicago out of the water, this museum is a lot better then that Childrens museum.  They have so many fun things to do, a fun water section, lots of things to experiment, lots of building activities, plenty of live animals....  But we really like the ""shows"" they do.  Theres one called sub zero right now where they show the effects of dry ice on things adn the kids get to play in the steam and watch rubber gloves get frozen and crack.... my kids are mesmerized.  Those shows are about every half hour on the weekends.

111,johnjones@yahoo.com,"One of my favorite places to go when I eat out, partially because it's close to home but mostly because it's good.  There's a buffet-style set-up.  You simply pay the cashier, grab a bowl and load it up.  There's a good assortment of meats and vegetables with a number of different sauces you can mix and match.  Experimentation is key so repeat visits will allow you to find your preferred mix.  After that, simply give your bowl to the cooks who will prepare it for you and you're ready to go.It's a very self-serve kind of place, which I like.  Everything's provided for you so waiters are unnecessary.  Drinks, sides (like rice or soup), condiments and an ice cream machine are all there for you.  When you're done, just leave your tray at the table and they'll pick it up.They aren't trying to wow you with atmosphere or decor and what little service you need is perfunctory.  Personally, I like the no-frills, self-serve set-up of the place... you're not there for an ""authentic Mongolian experience"" you're there for a good bowl of food with (hopefully) some friends.  If you're going to Metrocenter for a bite to eat, this is the place",2024-09-23 02:54:43

The only thing good about our meal was the water, orange juice and corn bread snack. Actually, the OJ was room temperature, so it was 'borderline good'.I ordered smoked pork chops, home fries and green beans. My Mom order salmon cakes, collard greens and mac-cheese. The pork chops had a good smoke flavor, but they were too salty and paper thin. The fries were over-cooked and soft. The green beans were greasy and tasted sweet. Sometimes, people will add a little sugar to green beans if they accidentally add too much salt; I believe that was the case.My Mom's salmon cakes were dry, the collard greens were flavorless and under cooked (probably just stir-fried) and the mac-cheese was dry.Not only was the food bad, but it wasn't even hot and my green beans had a little solid grease on them (eeewwwww!).I won't go back because the meal was expensive (wtip), the parking was terrible and the food was no good.It was a total disappointment for me.

Running in between and around my legs. Screaming, laughing, crying. Totally out of control. And this is all while we're standing in line. Suddenly I find my throat to be dry, irritated and burning.

What I mean by ""honest"" is that the piercers at Halo will actually take your anatomy and health into consideration before piercing you.

I sat for almost ten minutes at the window while my food was prepared.  During that time I wished I could have taken back my order and also wished that I hadn't paid already.  While sitting at the window I decided to just stare inside and watch some of the employees doing their job.  What disturbed me the most was watching the employee making the milkshakes.  Making a milkshake isn't that hard or glamorous of a thing to watch.  What disgusted me was that the guy actually lifted several of the containers for the milkshakes and smelt them.  I mean smelt them to see if they were clean, instead of actually taking the extra minute or two to clean the container.  After witnessing this my food was finally ready and I drove away.When I finally got to eating my food I was underwhelmed.  The fries had no flavor and with the size of the cut it appears you get more than what you ordered.

The spring rolls were definitely not fresh or homemade and were an extremely small portion for $3.50.

The Singapore Rice Noodles were supposed to be with shrimp but arrived with about two pieces of shrimp and about 15 pieces of chicken (mind you, I don't eat meat...and there was no mention of chicken on their menu).

I did eat the first half, but the bread was so tasteless, I thought maybe it would be better if I ate the other half piece by piece. The coleslaw was OK, but the french fries were awful, and the little bit of actual meat had little taste. We had little to no contact with employees, but a cab driver told us about a young couple who dared to ask for a sandwich at another Primanti Bros without coleslaw, and were treated really rudely.

He proceeded to add ingredients to my sandwich that I did not want, and he did not ask me, though he did ask my girlfriend. Weird. He then literally threw our sandwiches in a bag, slammed the bag on the counter in front of us, gave us two drinks, and gave me the total. About $17.

Once the check came, it had an extra appetizer charge, which then took a long time to get someone's attention to remove it.

Add to this the awful faux fireworks and drummer guy who spent half his time on the phone, and it was a very poor experience.",2024-10-29 11:59:46

If you like your Catholicism quiet and personal with a little organ music and perhaps some donuts after mass, then St. Mary's downtown Phoenix is the parish for you.Originally built in 1881, it is the oldest Catholic Church in Phoenix.  Staffed by the Franciscans and located in the heart of Downtown Phoenix.  The masses are traditional, thoughtful and beautiful.  The choir is phenomenal and there is an innate sense of family there-even as a guest.",2024-10-30 03:11:32

146,michael341@gmail.com,"While in this area of Charlotte I saw Bubba's BBQ I did not have but, a few minutes and I really just wanted to taste the Q . I went in the only people I saw was 2 people leaving . So with a quick look at the menu I ordered a BBQ sandwich ( no slaw this time I wanted to be able to taste the flavor of the Q then have slaw next time)So out came my sandwich and I noticed slaw on the outside of the sandwich I opened it and saw that the slaw well... some of it had been taken off about half was still there it looked as if someone had taken something and attempted to "" get the slaw off"".When I told the server she looked at the ticket and said "" I told them no slaw ""Then she left with the sandwich at this point I am wondering if they could not get a simple order with such a slow time then what else was wrong At that point I had spent way to much time just trying to get a simple sandwich put money on the table to pay for the Tea and left .I called shortly after a conference call to talk to the manager "" Bubba "" I told him the story and he first said "" describe the server "" then when I did he said "" What color was the slaw "" And I am thinking why would he ask that Does he think the slaw came from somewhere else When I told him I was not 100% sure he ""said we only serve this color slaw""( I think he said yellow) And I am still wondering why he said that ( AGAIN)To me this was getting me know where when I was just trying to explain to him what the problem was. I then just said "" have a good day and hung up""Do not think I will be back ... just a warning if you go to Bubbas do not keep it to simple and please please do not make the order very complicated. They may ask you where the food came from",2024-11-03 03:47:42

Workers are always friendly and smoothies are always top-notch. I think this is partly because this is the ""model"" or ""training"" facility for other Jamba Juices in the area.

IT is a giant pond,you can take little water crafts on it.  It has ducks and fish as well. They also have a lot of covered Picnic areas with grills so you can have Birthday Parties and such. All well lit also. Along with clean(as clean as you can get for a park) toliet areas. Lots of rolling hills for exercise or to bring your dog.Our dog loves coming here. It is like disney land for her.On the other side is the grat wave pool, and a great gym. The park offers all sorts of classes and sports leauges for all ages.Lots of places for kids to play.It is just great! The only thing I am not crazy about is on the weekends they sometimes also parties and get togethers here that drive me nuts. Because, the music will start early in the morning and go all night.It can really be loud at times even with your doors and windows closed.Unfortunatly I live close enough to hear it. But, if you have kids or dogs, it is a lot of fun and a great place to explore.",2024-11-04 09:53:30

266,egarcia@gmail.com,I've waited 10 minutes for a bread bowl soup...seriously! It's super slow and no one else is in line! The whole time the manager and employees have kept looking at me standing here and no one has bothered to ask me if I need any help. I finally had to speak up to get some service.

263,lisa.williams@outlook.com,"Having had a fantastic experience at the Gilbert (Val Vista and Williams Field) location with our entire staff for a employee's anniversary lunch, I figured Pita Jungle should be Pita Jungle, right  And the Chandler location is closer to our workplace, so I called and let them know that two days hence, we would be treating one of our employees to his anniversary lunch.       We would be a party of fifteen, and although I know they don't take reservations, I wanted to find out what we can do to make it less of a surprise for them, and smoother sailing for our healthcare office's staff (we would have a set period of time to eat and get back to see the afternoon patients).     She reiterated they don't take reservations.  I know, sweetie, I know.  I'm just calling to give you a head's up that we're going to show up at noon in 2 days' time and we would like for that to not be hard on your staff.  Or mine.  ""Okay,"" she said, stating she would make a note, ""but it isn't a reservation.""  Okay, I gotcha.    I called the day before to re-remind them we'd be there in one day, at noon, with 15 hungry people.  ""We can't, we don't, we won't,"" etc, she says.  I know, honey, I know you don't take reservations, I know what you can't and don't do in terms of reservations. Do you ACCEPT larger parties ""Yes,"" she says.  ""So, I'm just calling to see what CAN be done"" I say.  ""I'll make a note but you can't have a reservation.""  My goodness, it's never been harder for me to arrange to drop a few benji's on a small establishment.  The Gilbert location was gracious, had left a few tables in one area free, then scooted them together when our party arrived (just a couple months prior) and had us seated in one minute flat, gracious and happy to see us... so I figured with the ample heads-up, the Chandler location would probably do the same, right    Right     We show up, 15 of us, at noon the next day.  The young, male (old enough to drive, too young to drink) host is astounded at the size of our party. Like, he has never SEEN 15 people all together at one time before, ASTOUNDED.  I mention that while we know they don't do reservations, I've called ahead two days, and one day, prior. *crickets* She said she would make a note, let you all know we would be coming so you could plan ahead. *crickets*  To make sure you wouldn't be overwhelmed by our party. *crickets*  Because we are celebrating a much-loved employee's anniversary and it's really important because this is his favorite restaurant.  *crickets*       ""Well,"" he sighs, ""I don't know anything about that but it's going to be at LEAST a half hour wait. Is that okay""       There's no harm in asking nicely, so I did.  ""Well, actually, is there anything that can be done We have about 49 minutes of lunch time left, so that doesn't really enable us to eat, is there any room out on that big patio There's a large table down the middle of the restaurant that's just the right size for our party, which was completely empty, until you sat two people in the middle of it, like, 4 seconds before we were greeted, could they potentially sit somewhere else Because we'd fit right there and they don't even have a water glass yet; I would pay for their lunch.""       No.  There was obviously nothing he was willing to do, so I let him know that anything they can do is appreciated, because all 15 of us are here, and there's no time to arrange anything new.  So we wait for 19 minutes, and he comes over and tell us ""It's going to be at least another 40 minutes, so is that okay""     No.  That wasn't okay, not even remotely okay, and honestly I expect to be treated like this at Oregano's, pal, but I really didn't see this one coming. Why would you tell us 30 minutes, and 11 minutes short of the 30 minutes, tell us it's another 40 minutes  You've been seating everyone who came in the door.  I asked if there was a manager. Nope.  Is there anyone I can talk to (Because I'm thinking as a manager, I see potential solutions to this problem passing before my eyes with every choice you make, friend.)  Nope.        I know the kid is young.  And this is not his place.  And he can't possibly have enough experience to even know what customer care looks or sounds like... but he couldn't have possibly been slow enough to think that, on any level, this was okay.      So, in order to not break my recent goals of never saying reactive things, I simply walked out the door.  Saw Valle Luna just down the walk, and walked in there to ask if they'd seat us.  Sure, they said, come on over!     So all 15 of us mobbed down to Valle Luna, had just about the most delicious chips and salsa I've ever had, cold drinks on the table right away, and hot lunch served up within about 10 minutes, a check and boxes shortly thereafter, and we were back to the office on time, stuffed full of really delicious and satisfying food.  Please consider going there; they were fantastic.",2024-11-04 21:22:15

207,michael.martinez20@protonmail.com,"Luna used to be my favorite restaurant when it was on campus. It has changed. I don't know the reason, but it is just not the same restaurant.The last two times in a row that I went there, someone I was with ordered poultry and received it uncooked. I mean purple and bloody, too, not just slightly pink. I swear to god it could have clucked, Each time, a waitress unapologetically whisked the dish away to be cooked further only to bring it back still bloody. I have never seen poultry THAT undercooked in a restaurant before. Ever. And the cooks couldn't even cook it through the second time The person who ordered it touched the meat and said it was quite cool. For crissake I know the recession is bad, but can they really not splurge for a frickin meat thermometerMeat like that should never be served, but the fact that both times it was sent out AGAIN with cold, purple blood-pools inside was just sick. On top of that, the food isn't as good anymore, they took 20 minutes to seat us even though we had a reservation, and they refused to give us any kind of discount even though the meat was not edible! They didn't apologize or act like they cared at all. It kills me to write this, but Luna as C-U knew it is gone.",2024-11-10 05:16:39
17,john.martinez99@outlook.com,"I shan't be returning.Their festive signage caught me on the way to another venue for lunch, and I thought ""why not Chinese""  I'll tell you why; or at least, why not to select this buffet.Being greeted on the way in with a ""You are on camera"" sign sure is welcoming.  I was quickly greeted, though, and directed to my seat.  My drink order was taken before I even sat down, which was nice.  Too many buffets have you walk in, sit down, select a beverage, stand up, and proceed to self-service, and it was nice to save a couple of steps.But then I got to the food.  Nearly everything had the congealed look of having been out too long; the skin on the surface of the sweet-and-sour sauce was rubbery and at least a half-centimeter thick.  Not exactly appetizing.  I did, however, find some acceptable-looking specimens and returned to my table.The warmest of the foods could only generously be called lukewarm; most of the chicken was marbled with glibbery wads of fat, and all the sauces tasted sugary and generic.  I could literally not tell the ""orange chicken"" from the ""sesame chicken"" from the ""pepper chicken"" by any sense other than sight.The rice was room-temperature, but I barely know this because as I was forking a mouthful of rice together on the plate, the alternately obsequious and intrusive waitstaff tried to take my plate out from under me (though, in retrospect, they may have been trying to save me).The fruit selection, which I also sampled, looked fine, but was in fact soggy and also room-temperature to lukewarm.They have a somewhat vast dessert selection -- particularly for a buffet -- but I'd more than had my fill.Walking toward the register, there was a prominent sign re-advising me that walk-outs are recorded and will be reported to the police and prosecuted.  There were three more similar signs at the registergift shop (!).  Again, very welcoming.I won't be back, unless I'm told they're under new management.",2024-11-11 21:41:24
